The Orientation of your print can have a huge impact on the quality, speed and material usage of your print.

Here we have a quite simple Table like object in 3 different orientations.

Try it yourself, print with default settings, but support on.
should take about 40-60 minutes, and 15g of filament.

Now compare surface finish.

Be aware that this is a compromise, the same lesson from 02 applies here.
If you need stable legs and a nice tabletop, print them separately and glue them together.
