# Printing Curves

We are dealing with the same Object here, once with the Curve in the Z-plane and once in the X-plane.

The Object with the Curve in the Z-plane will have a much smoother curve, since the curve is printed with  the X/Y Mmovements, 
while the other one relays on layer lines to create the curve.

Try it yourself, print with default settings.
should take about 10-15 minutes, and 2g of filament.

Now compare the surfaces finnish of the curves on both objects.
