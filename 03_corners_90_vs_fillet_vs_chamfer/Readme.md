# Stress points in corners

we have 3 models here, basically the flat laying from the previous example, but with different corner types.

- one again with the same 90Â° corners
- one with fillets
- one with chamfers

Try it yourself, print with default settings.
should take about 10-15 minutes, and 3g of filament.


Then try to break them as before and compare the results.
